Interviewd is an app that allows students to practice commonly asked questions during student leadership interviews by recording and review their transcribed response. From there, the app will be able to count the number of occurring words and stutters the user has made in their response. 


# Similarity Checker 

We will also add a function which will allow the user to compare the similarity between the user's response and script. Which is similar to Turnitin but this time we encourage plagiarizing your own script! One of the cool factors of this function is to highlight the user's transcribed response (which is similar to the video below) and script that conveys the same key idea of that message. By doing this, this allows the user to express their key ideas verbally without reciting their script.
